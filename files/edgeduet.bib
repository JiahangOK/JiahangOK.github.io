	abstract = {Accurate, real-time object detection on resourceconstrained devices enables autonomous mobile vision applications such as trafﬁc surveillance, situational awareness, and safety inspection, where it is crucial to detect both small and large objects in crowded scenes. Prior studies either perform object detection locally on-board or ofﬂoad the task to the edge/cloud. Local object detection yields low accuracy on small objects since it operates on low-resolution videos to ﬁt in mobile memory. Ofﬂoaded object detection incurs high latency due to uploading high-resolution videos to the edge/cloud. Rather than either pure local processing or ofﬂoading, we propose to detect large objects locally while ofﬂoading small object detection to the edge. The key challenge is to reduce the latency of small object detection. Accordingly, we develop EdgeDuet, the ﬁrst edge-device collaborative framework for enhancing small object detection with tile-level parallelism. It optimizes the ofﬂoaded detection pipeline in tiles rather than the entire frame for high accuracy and low latency. Evaluations on drone vision datasets under LTE, WiFi 2.4GHz, WiFi 5GHz show that EdgeDuet outperforms local object detection in small object detection accuracy by 233.0\%. It also improves the detection accuracy by 44.7\% and latency by 34.2\% over the state-of-the-art ofﬂoading schemes.},
